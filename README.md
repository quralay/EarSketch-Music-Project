# EarSketch-Music-Project
During my summer studies at Viginia Tech University, I created my first project on EarSketch. Music was developed through JavaScript code lines, and it combines guitar, drum beat sounds.

The song is guitar, bass, and drums, with a cool change in the middle. It isÂ about breaking free from things that are holding you back, such as your own fears, what others expect, or problems. The song's powerful guitar, bass, and drums make you feel empowered and liberated. "Find your voice, do what you want, and go for your dreams!"
